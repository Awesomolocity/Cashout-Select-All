# Cashout Select All

This adds a "Select All" button to the Station Summary view of the Cashout page. It was created after seeing leads spend unforgivable amounts of time manually selecting hundreds of agents in order to cash them out at the end of the night.

Hopefully this saves them time.

## Installation Instructions

Note: These instructions are for Microsoft Edge. You may need to adapt some things for other browsers such as Google Chrome or Firefox.

- Install a Userscript manager
  - The one I recommend most is [ViolentMonkey](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/violentmonkey/eeagobfjdenkkddmbclomhiblgggliao).
  - You can also use [TamperMonkey](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd).

- Install this Userscript
  - Navigate to this repo's [select-all.user.js](https://github.com/Awesomolocity/Cashout-Select-All/raw/refs/heads/main/select-all.user.js) raw file
  - The page should prompt you to "Install" the script. Select the install button.

## Usage Instructions
